# Project
    
This is  project is containing a rest api using nestjs and an angular client that consumes the api created using nestjs

## Nest 

The api contains functions and operations that manages products and orders 

## Angular 

The angular client sends http requests to the server then manipulate the responses




# How to instal

## Server side 

Tirst of all you need to instal the nestjs application by reaching the backend folder and installing dependencies using the command :
"npm i --save" 
then we start the server using the command  :
"npm run start:dev" 

PS : the default listening port of nestjs server is 3000 you can change it in src/main.ts
(Cross-origin resource sharing is already enabled)

## Client Side

To run the angular project you should get into the folder named frontend then run the command :"npm i --save"
to instal the dependencies then run the command :"ng serve" 
to start the server by default the port of this angular project is 4200 you can run it in a different port using this command : 
"ng serve --port "port number"" 

PS : the client isn't yet complete -- to test the more api functionalities you can use an api client 
like  (postman , insomnia, ...)
